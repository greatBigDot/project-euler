A methodical attack on the "Project Euler" programming challenges.

Project Euler is a well known collection of math-based programming challenges.
There are currently over 600 problems, and new ones are added every few weeks.
They range in difficulty from fizz-buzz level problems to extremely difficult
and intricate puzzles even a professional computer scientist would find
challenging. The problems can be found at: https://projecteuler.net. Once you
think you've found an answer, you can enter it to see if you're right.
(Submitting answers requires an account; making one is free and does not
require any information other than a username and password.)

I figures Idris is a rather appropriate language for attacking math-based
programming puzzles, considering its relationship to mathematical logic (see
Curry-Howard isomorphism) and seeing as one can actually prove programs correct.
